## My process

### Built with

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Summary

I wanted to practice using tailwind CSS for styling and using react.
It's not practical to use react for such small projects such as this but I really wanted to get used to the format.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - The tailwind documentation is really helpful and it has everything you really need to get you started on learning tailwind
